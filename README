This Feature depends on CKEditor. While everything is properly configured by
the Feature, the CKEditor library is not included.

Therefore, you must get the CKEditor library and install it to your libraries
folder (sites/*/libraries).

The CKEditor library can be downloaded from http://ckeditor.com/download

You will also need to assign the "Filtered HTML (WYSIWYG)" text format to the
roles that you want to be able to use it.
